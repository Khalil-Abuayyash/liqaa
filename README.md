# LIQAA

## Overview
LIQAA is an innovative platform designed to facilitate mock interviews and skill development. Unlike traditional interview prep platforms that limit participation to enrolled students, LIQAA offers a more flexible approach. Users can apply for interviews on any topic, connect with peers or experts, and gain valuable practice.

The platform supports job interview preparation, thesis defenses, presentations, and public speaking. It integrates with tools like Google Meet and Calendly, with plans to introduce built-in video calling and scheduling features.
